------

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Goal
Building an application where students can find tutors of various hobbies, and teachers can post their hobbies to recruit students. As students of Flatiron School, we came to value the one-on-one teaching sessions with our instructors. There are various applications to find group lessons nearby, but we wanted to build something specifically for individual tutoring sessions. 

### Functions 
Know Matter is a double authentication application, meaning a user can sign in either as a student or a teacher. The authentication will permit or deny access to certain actions and URL's based on the user's session type. As a student, you can either login (with authenticated username & password) or signup, browse different hobbies, browse teachers, book and request to cancel lessons, and see all your existing lessons. As a teacher, you have the same initialization functions (login or signup), can browse other hobbies on the site, add timeslots to your tutor sessions, confirm or deny students' lesson requests or cancellations. 

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

1. Have at least 5 models. 
2. Have at least 20 methods total in the models. They are to be used to better extract data from the tables. 
3. Analytical component to the application (write some interesting ActiveRecord queries) 
4. No JavaScript. Stay focused on Rails for this project. 

Time allocated: 5 days
